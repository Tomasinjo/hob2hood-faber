# hob2hood-faber
Controlling unsupported Faber hood using AEG Hob2Hood. Input signals coming from induction hob (that supports hob2hood) get "translated" to apropriate output IR signals that are used to control the hood.

## Hardware 
Follow this guide for instructions about parts.
https://www.instructables.com/Web-IR-Remote-With-Esp8266-NodeMCU/

Use code in the guide to record IR codes used by hood's IR remote (If Faber hood is used, you can skip this step because IR codes are included).
